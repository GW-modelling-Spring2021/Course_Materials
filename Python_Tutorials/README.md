# Python Tutorials
This folder contains tutorials that might be helpful as you start to navigate the wonderful world of python.  These are for your reference only, they are not assigned work.

## Assignment:
If you want to test your knowledge, you can read through the following sets of python related questions.  One place to start for resources is this online text book: https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/thinkcspy/index.html. But some googling might bring you to better resources for whatever item you are working on.


### Data types:
#### 1. Lists
-	What is a list?
-	What types of things can go into it?
-	How do lists with multiple dimensions work (i.e. when we use the [][] notation)?
-	How do you index a list?
-	How can we see what’s in a list and what the attributes of a list are?
-	How can we do math on a list or manipulate it?
-	How do you get parts of a list out?
-	How can we write the elements of a list to a file or plot it?

#### 2. Dictionaries
-	What is a dictionary?
-	What types of things can go into it?
-	How is it different than a list?
-	How can we see what’s in it and what its properties are?
-	How do you get things out of it?
-	How do you manipulate or change it?
-	How can you write it out to a file or plot it?  

#### 3. Numpy Arrays and numpy rec.arrays
-	What is a numpy array?
-	How is this different form a list?
-	How can we see what’s in it and what its properties are?
-	How do you get things out of it?
-	How do you manipulate or change it?
-	How can you write it out to a file or plot it?  
-	What is a rec.array? and how is it different form a normal array?
-	How can you see the properties of this and access it? (Some of this is covered in the Recharge Self Check notebook and you can pull from this if you want).
-	How do we get things out of it and manipulate it?
-	Provide examples of both regular arrays and rec arrays in your submission.

#### 4. Flopy data types, head and budget files
-	How do we read in these files?
-	What type of object do we have when we read it in?
-	How can we learn about the properties and variables associated with these files?
-	What are the built in flopy tools for working with these objects?
-	How do we handle the fact that they have multiple timesteps?
-	How can we extract data from these files to make plots or write to a file? (thing about both if we want to make a timeseries at a point or if we want to make a graph that is a snapshot of the whole domain at a given time).
