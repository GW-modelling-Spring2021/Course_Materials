# Python Tutorials
This folder contains tutorials on the main python data structures that we work with in this classroom

## Assignment:
For this assignment we will be dividing into groups and creating jupyter notebooks to explain key python data types.  The jupyter notebook you create will essentially be a tutorial which you will present in class and will be put into this folder as resource for everyone to refer back to. The formats may differ but for each notebook you should include the following:
 1. A brief summary of what your thing is and how we should understand it.
 2. Links for any tutorials or online explanations you found particularly helpful.
 3. A code block with an annotated list of key commands to know when working with your item (basically a quick cheat sheet we can refer back to)
 4. Walk through the properties of the item you have been assigned interspersing code and text but try not to make it too long.  I’ve provided some lists of questions your explanation should cover but this is not exhaustive so feel free to expand on what you think is useful and organize it however you feel will be most useful to others.
 5. An annotated example pulling from our course materials on where this data type gets used in our workflows, how we make it, manipulate it, use it, plot it etc.

### Other notes:
1.	One place to start for resources is the online text book we used at the start of the class: https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/thinkcspy/index.html. But also some googling might bring you to better resources for whatever item you are working on.
2.	This is a team assignment so you should just create one notebook for your group

### Data types:
#### 1. Lists (Justin & Jake)
-	What is a list?
-	What types of things can go into it?
-	How do lists with multiple dimensions work (i.e. when we use the [][] notation)?
-	How do you index a list?
-	How can we see what’s in a list and what the attributes of a list are?
-	How can we do math on a list or manipulate it?
-	How do you get parts of a list out?
-	How can we write the elements of a list to a file or plot it?

#### 2. Dictionaries (Amanda, Danielle and Abe)
-	What is a dictionary?
-	What types of things can go into it?
-	How is it different than a list?
-	How can we see what’s in it and what its properties are?
-	How do you get things out of it?
-	How do you manipulate or change it?
-	How can you write it out to a file or plot it?  

#### 3. Numpy Arrays and numpy rec.arrays (Rachel and Vivek)
-	What is a numpy array?
-	How is this different form a list?
-	How can we see what’s in it and what its properties are?
-	How do you get things out of it?
-	How do you manipulate or change it?
-	How can you write it out to a file or plot it?  
-	What is a rec.array? and how is it different form a normal array?
-	How can you see the properties of this and access it? (Some of this is covered in the Recharge Self Check notebook and you can pull from this if you want).
-	How do we get things out of it and manipulate it?
-	Provide examples of both regular arrays and rec arrays in your submission.

#### 4. Flopy data types, head and budget files (Ben, Dave & Tesfa)
-	How do we read in these files?
-	What type of object do we have when we read it in?
-	How can we learn about the properties and variables associated with these files?
-	What are the built in flopy tools for working with these objects?
-	How do we handle the fact that they have multiple timesteps?
-	How can we extract data from these files to make plots or write to a file? (thing about both if we want to make a timeseries at a point or if we want to make a graph that is a snapshot of the whole domain at a given time).
