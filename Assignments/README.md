# Assignments
Please copy files from this folder into your homework repo to do your work.

## Setting up your homework repo
You can structure your homework repo however you would like. It is your space to work in. The only mandatory part is that you must have a submissions folder. This is where you will put the portions of your work (and only those portions of your work) that you would like me to grade.
1. Before you start you should have local copies of the course_materials repo and your homework repo on your computer. Refer back to the install instructions if you have questions.
2. Open both repos in GitKraken and hit the 'Pull' button to make sure both  are up to date.
3. Copy the gitignore.txt file that is in this directory to the main directory of your homework repo (you can just do this as you normally would copy any file).
4. Rename the 'gitignore.txt' file to '.gitignore' **NOTE** it needs to be exactly this. It must start with a period and should not have the .txt extension.  Files that start with '.' are hidden files so after you do this you many not see the file  in your finder anymore.
5. Create a folder called 'Submissions' in your homework repo. You can do this by opening the cloned repo folder on your computer and creating a folder the same way you normally would.
6. Commit and push your changes:
  - Open your homework repo on GitKraken use the guide on the right to 'stage all changes'
  - Enter a commit message explaining what your changes where in the bottom right and then hit 'stage files/changes to commit'
  - Hit the 'Push' button in the top panel to push your changes to GitHub

## Submitting your first homework assignment
1. Create a folder called HW1 (or whatever you want) in your homework repo and copy the starter codes and files into this folder.
2. Do whatever work you need to complete your Homework
3. When you are done take whatever you would like to submit and copy it into the submissions folder. Name your file with the HW number and your name.
4. Commit and push your changes:
  - Open your homework repo on GitKraken use the guide on the right to 'stage all changes'
  - Enter a commit message explaining what your changes where in the bottom right and then hit 'stage files/changes to commit'
  - Hit the 'Push' button in the top panel to push your changes to GitHub
