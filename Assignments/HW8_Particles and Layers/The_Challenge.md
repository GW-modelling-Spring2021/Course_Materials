# Layers and particles

No flopy code was provided to you this week!  


### Model Description
​Add particles to last week’s model.  Run your equivalent steady state model (annualized pumping rate) model.  Use particles to track the time capture zone for the well after 25, 50, 75, 100 years of pumping.  Bonus, see if you can use color to show captured particles!

Then, break last week’s model into three horizontal layers:
- Top 20 m unconfined sand
- Middle 10 m confined silt
- Remaining unconfined sand

The pump only extracts water from the bottom layer and recharge occurs in the uppermost undrained layer.  Repeat your particle tracking for capture zone analyses for the layered model.  


### The Challenges
a) How does the capture zone evolve in time?  Where does the early time capture zone get its water?  

b) Where does the 'infinite time' capture zone get its water?

c) How does the extent of the capture zone change when layers are considered?  Can you still define a 2D capture zone??

d) How does the extent of the 'infinite time' capture zone change when layers are added?  Explain any difference in the lateral extent of the capture zone along the left boundary.    


### Correct Key Figures

In my opinion, there are two key figures.

a) Time capture zone for four times and and infinite capture zone without layers.  You can combine these into one figure or show a separate figure for each time.

b) Time capture zone for four times and and infinite capture zone with layers.  You can combine these into one figure or show a separate figure for each time.


Due dates are the same as for the stream package exercise.  Sunday night: submit the key figures.  Monday night: submit your initial responses to The Challenge.  Tuesday night: submit your final responses to The Challenge.

Enjoy!


### Discussion Points
**In addition to The Challenge, start thinking about the following ideas**

Your stumpers were plenty of extra discussion!
