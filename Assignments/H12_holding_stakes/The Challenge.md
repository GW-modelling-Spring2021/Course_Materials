# Representing a stakeholder group

This is an extension and continuation of the previous Challenge.  For this assignment, work in your chosen stakeholder groups.  Each group should produce a single report that does the following.


### Model Description
â€‹
The model is identical to those that you used last week.  But, you will run different ensembles.

### The Challenges

Describe, in words, three scenarios that best represent the interests of your stakeholder group.  These can be some combination of design parameters (if relevant) such as which crop to grow or where to place the ag well and field and predictions of interest (if relevant) such as change in flow in the river or source of water for the town well.

For each of the scenarios, show all of the lines in the code that you would have to change (and how to change them) to represent that scenario.

A .csv file is provided to describe a common model ensemble.  Run this ensemble for each of your scenarios and report on the results - what does the ensemble indicate about the interests of your stakeholder group.

Identify one of the scenarios, develop a utility curve and show the threshold for MOC definition.  Describe how you would augment the ensemble with 10 additional models and explain your rationale.  Then generate the 10 additional models.  Create a .csv file with the filenames and save it as, for example, town_added_models.csv.

Discuss how adding the models did or did not change the interpretation of your stakeholder regarding their likely support for / opposition to the proposed ag development.

(Note that you will have to think about how to craft your discussion slightly differently if you choose to change a design parameter.)

In short, you are being asked to do the kind of analysis that you were asked to do for HW11, but do it specifically on behalf of a particular stakeholder.



### Correct Key Figures

There are no correct figures to compare to.  But, you can use the figures posted for the previous assignment as a guide if you are deciding how to interpret the results.   

### What is Due? When?

Sunday night: Post at least one of your scenarios and the required code changes.  Also show the key figures that you will use to describe the predicted impact of the proposed ag facility on your stakeholder using the proscribed model ensemble.

Monday night: Post your initial discussion of the predicted impact of the ag facility on your stakeholder.  Explain how you will decide which models to add to the ensemble and post your .csv of models to add to the ensemble.  

Tuesday: come to class ready to model.  Each group will be asked to add specific models to your ensemble and discuss the impacts of these added models on your stakeholder's decision to support or fight the ag development.

Wednesday night: post your final discussion of the predicted impacts of the proposed ag facility on your stakeholder based on your initial scenarios.


Enjoy!
