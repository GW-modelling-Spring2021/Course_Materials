# Recharge Me

A flopy code is provided to you that recreates the 3D homogeneous box model with constant head boundary conditions.  The aquifer is now defined as unconfined.  You will use this to explore the combined impacts of recharge, ET, and pumping on an unconfined aquifer.     

### Model Description
​The model that you have been provided is set up for a homogeneous medium.  There is a well located at [0,15,15], but it is not being pumped.  The background recharge rate is zero.  There is a region of localized recharge in [6:10, 6:10] - in python terms - with a recharge rate of 5e-4 m/day.  ET occurs over the entire domain at a rate of 5e-4 m/day and an extinction depth of 3 m.  The left and right boundaries have constant heads of 15 and 5, respectively.      



### The Challenge
a. For the initial boundary head values and recharge and ET rates, establish the head versus y-distance along the left (15 m) and right (5 m) boundaries.  Plot the equipotentials and flow vectors in plan view and outline (hand draw) the area that would be affected by recharge (i.e. if it were contaminated).  Also show a contour plot of the steady state ET flux in plan view.  

b. Change the extinction depth.  What impacts does this have?  

c. Explain, conceptually, how MODFLOW is representing ET.  How does this compare to your intuitive understanding of ET in the real world?

d. Now start the well pumping, extracting 20 m3/day.  How does the well change the zone that is affected by the recharge area?  How does it affect the ET map?  Write a mass balance for the well - how much water is coming from a boundary?  How much is originating as recharge?  How do you account for the impact of ET on this mass balance?  At steady state, what are the effects of 'capture' by the well?



### Correct Key Figures

Next level.  

Decide as a class if you have found the right figures!!  I am more than happy to answer questions.  But, I want you to try to do these analyses independently first!  



### The Socratic Method
**This is going to be challenging ... but, I think that you will benefit from it!  Worst case, we will only do it for one week!!**

I am a strong believer in the idea that you only really learn something when you try to teach it to someone else.  I'm also pretty sold on the idea that teaching is helping someone to learn something for themselves whenever possible, rather than just telling them the answer.  So, I'd like you to give the Socratic Method a try.  In your groups of 2 or 3, do the following:

a. Meet to discuss The Challenge.  Try to identify what each of you feels like you know well and what you feel like you do not know as well. 
b. Each of you should take charge of at least one thing that the other person doesn't know well.  Study it to the point that you understand it.  Ask me if you are stuck.  Your goal is to advance the other person's knowledge of that topic!
c. Meet again.  Each of you should teach the other the topic that you have investigated.  Try, to the degree possible, to avoid telling the other person the answer ... rather, guide them to understand the topic by asking them questions.  
d. Each of you should write an individual answer to The Challenge.  Note who your partner(s) was(were) and let me know which topic you took the lead on explaining.

Due dates are the same.  Sunday night: submit the key figures.  Monday night: submit your initial responses to The Challenge.  Tuesday night: submit your final responses to The Challenge.

Enjoy!



### Discussion Points
**In addition to The Challenge, start thinking about the following ideas**

I think that you have enough to consider from The Challenge without adding more this week!
