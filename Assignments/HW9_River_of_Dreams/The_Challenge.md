# Streams

A flopy code is provided to you that simulates flow in a single layer model including a stream that runs along the center column.  There is uniformly distributed recharge over part of the domain.  There is no ET.  The aquifer is unconfined.  You will use this to explore stream-aquifer exchange.       


### Model Description
â€‹The model that you have been provided is set up for a homogeneous medium.  However, the streambed conductivity changes within three zones along the stream.  The single-layer domain is 51x51 cells.  The cells are 10 m in lateral and vertical extent. Recharge occurs at a rate of 5e-5 m/day in the first 26 rows.  The left and right boundaries have defined heads to represent a lake and a river, respectively.    


### The Challenges
a) The code is provided to produce the first set of 'correct' figures.  Use these figures to describe the nature (direction/magnitude) of stream/aquifer exchange along the stream.  In particular, explain why the leakage changes magnitude or direction where these values change.

b) Use the head distribution to describe the movement of water across the boundaries and into/out of the stream.    

c) Choose two things to explore (e.g. impact of streambed K or inflow into the river or recharge rate).  Produce a plot for each to compare to the base plots and use the plots to explain the impact of the hydrologic change.


### Correct Key Figures

The correct base figures are provided.

Please check your figures and explanation with at least one other student before turning them in.  Include their comments in your initial submission!


### What is Due? When?

Sunday night: nothing is due.  But, I'm happy to look at your initial submission if you want to turn it in early.

Monday night: your two one-at-a-time changes to the system - describe the change, show the flow and head plots before and after, explain why the hydrologic change led to the model output change.  Also include comments from at least one other student on your interpretation of the plots.

Tuesday: come to class ready to share your results and explanations.

Wednesday night: your final submission.


Enjoy!
